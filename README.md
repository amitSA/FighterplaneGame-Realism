FighterplaneGame-Realism
========================

Another fighterplane game I made, this time for my APCS class final, it isnt fully completed and is still be worked on

Description
The game can be both a single-player and multi-player game.  The program is desgined to offer a fun time-waster to users.  The single-player version of the game involves
the user-plane to travel forward in an endless 2d world and accumulate the most points possible.  The player can get points by shooting down enemy planes spawn ahead of them.
The game gets progressively harder the more deeper in the world the user-plane travels, when the user-plane dies.  The multiplayer version of the game involves 2 players to be 
pitted against each other in a duel, both players will have an equal number of AI planes.
     *Note: right now only the single-player game is implemented
     
     
Instructions
1.  Up Arrow - moves the user plane up
    Down Array - moves the user plane down
    Space Bar - shoots bullets
    *The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can
